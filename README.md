## Google Maps SDK for Android

> [!Important]
> The project is currently at its very basic stage, and there are many more ideas and features that have yet to be explored. Itâ€™s possible that we could integrate `Gemini` in some way to enhance a feature that could potentially become a feature in Google Maps.

This repo is to explore the Google Maps SDK for Android by trying it out in an Android App powered by `Kotlin`.
